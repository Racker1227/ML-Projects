Rainfall Prediction Model üå¶Ô∏è
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict rainfall based on historical weather data, aiming to support effective planning and decision-making.

Key Steps:
Data Collection: Collected historical weather and rainfall data from reliable sources.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzed data trends, distributions, and relationships to uncover meaningful patterns and anomalies.

Data Preprocessing: Performed tasks such as handling missing data, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features to prepare the dataset for modeling.

Train-Test Split: Divided the data into training and testing subsets to evaluate model performance.

Random Forest Classifier: Employed this ensemble technique for its ability to handle complex datasets and provide robust predictions.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimized model parameters using Grid Search and Randomized Search to enhance performance.

Evaluation: Achieved a test set accuracy of 85.1%, with balanced precision, recall, and F1-scores.

Deployment: Tested the model on unseen data to validate its reliability and readiness for real-world applications.

Prediction: Designed the model to forecast rainfall based on new weather data inputs.

Highlights:
Achieved 85.1% test accuracy, demonstrating strong predictive performance.

Balanced metrics for both "Rain" and "No Rain" classes.

Practical application in weather forecasting and risk management.

This project showcases the application of machine learning techniques to solve real-world challenges, emphasizing data cleaning, feature engineering, and model optimization.
